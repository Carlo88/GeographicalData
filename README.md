# GeographicalData
Geographical Description Example.

This example uses a Dataset (Ottobre.csv) supported by a json file describing the shape of the regions.
GeoPandas helps to plot regions with colors based on values in Ottobre.csv.

There is also an Excel with CAP-REGION-CITY: Ottobre.csv has only the City and not the region.
